# Prevent Mode Collapse in GANs

This project explores the use of persistent homology, a tool from topological data analysis, to detect and prevent mode collapse in Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs). The aim is to quantify the topological diversity of generated data and incorporate this feedback to encourage the generator to capture the full distribution of the target data.
